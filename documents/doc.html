Welcome to Comstock docs.

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<paragrph>
The first motivation for Comstock is to preserve complicated command to the cloud. 
For many people, simpliest way for storing complicated command is "copy & paste". 
And in most cases, they're using online memo tools such as Evernote, Wri.pe, etc.
It is kind of annoying work to make copy and paste commands to the online memo service, as you may know already,
because we are not good at mouse manipulating ("Damn, forget to copy the last character!"), 
or remembering which commands are in which. (Most cases, you don't remember the command and this make you more difficult to search it)

I want a simple tool that can store your prefavor command with simple way, just type "command save".
And this is why I started Comstock! Comstock provides you the simplest way to storing your commands avoiding annoying procedures.
